Hey guys, woofle here

We had *just* finished the mod when all of a sudden, psych engine got updated

This update messed up the typing events for Monojack, so I didn't wanna deal with fixing it for new update

So that's why it's outdated, i might update it at some point

Who knows?

Thanks for downloading Friday Night Funkin': VS Jackhammer!
